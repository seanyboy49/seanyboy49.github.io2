			<h1>The Question of the Century</h1>
			<p>
				Since the beginning of time, mankind has found itself in moments of deep introspection over questions of such monumental importance, that national barriers, religion and differing ideologies were briefly cast aside in an effort to find the answers, lest humanity be thrown into chaos.

		<h3>Some notes on this website</h3>
			<p>
				One of my favourite websites is <a href="http://9gag.com/">9gag</a>, a humourous image based website.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I inspect the site, I see very familiar elements like embedded images and gifs, as well as alt attributes that describe the visual element.
				I would like to learn more about how they rank the content of their page so that only the best content gets pushed to the top. A friend and I had an idea of making a 9gag or imgur type website but only for science related content. We wanted to pull content directly from IFLS and science subreddits and allow people to upvote content into a personalized feed.
